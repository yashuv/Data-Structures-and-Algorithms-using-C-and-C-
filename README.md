# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-using-C-and-Cpp
This document contains the DSA-related notes and code implementation that I created during the 4th semester of my undergraduate studies at the university.

I learned a lot about data structures and algorithms. I learned how to make sure that my code was efficient and would run quickly.<br>
Since the C language has no built-in data structures like arrays and linked lists, I have used it for implementing various data structures and shown how to implement the operations on them. Hence, I feel that it is the most suitable and perfect language for implementing data structures. Beside that, it is possible to write programs that are very efficient and close to the hardware.<br>
As we know, C++ is an extension of the C language, so C++ is also used somewhere for its simplicity. I recommend the learners be familiar with these languages in order to learn data structures.

<h4>What is data structure and algorithm?</h4> <br>
Data structures and algorithms are two related concepts. Data structures are the way we organize and store data in structured way in memory. They provide a way to organize data in a way that makes it easy to find information quickly.It is a type of object that represents a specific kind of data in a computer. For example, an array is a data structure that stores a group of related values in a particular order. It's like a box where you can put things based on their size or shape. A linked list is another type of data structure that stores its elements in an ordered list. The elements can be accessed by order number or by index number (the position of the element within the list).<br>
 Algorithms are the rules that govern how you can use a data structure to solve a problem. Algorithms are often used in computer science because they allow us to solve problems faster than we could by hand—and sometimes even faster than computers themselves can do! For example, if you have a large list of numbers that need to be sorted as quickly as possible, you might use a data structure like an array or linked list to keep track of each number's position in the list. Then, instead of having to compare each number one-by-one to see which one comes first, you can use an algorithm that compares the numbers by their position in the array or linked list.

 Importance od data structures and algorithms:<br>
 Data structures and algorithms are the two most important parts of computer science. They are important for a number of reasons. First, they provide a way to store and organize data in a way that is efficient and easy to access. Second, they provide a way to design and analyze algorithms, which are used to solve problems. Finally, they provide a way to understand and use complex data structures.

Algorithms are used in all sorts of applications—from word processors and communication systems to databases and operating systems.
